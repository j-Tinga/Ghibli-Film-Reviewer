# Ghibi: A Studio Ghibli Film Library

Ghibi is a mobile film library for all of Studio Ghibli Films that allows users to scroll through Ghibli Films, save them in a watch list, and write and store reviews for specific Ghibli Films that they have watched.
The app uses the [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/) for retrieving Studio Ghibli Film data.
The app currently uses SQLite for storing local data.

## Objectives
This project is a requirement for the completion of the Mobile Development (CIS 2203) in the Department of Computer, Information Sciences and Mathematics of the University of San Carlos.

Through this project, I was able to:
- Utilize what I learn about making mobile apps through Flutter throughout the mobile development course.
- Learn how to utilize an API in a mobile app.
- Learn how to implement a back-end for a mobile app (Firebase or SQLite)
